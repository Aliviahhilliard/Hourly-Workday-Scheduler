# Hourly-Workday-Scheduler

## Description

In this simple application, I have modified starter code to build a calendar for users to save the events for each hour of their work day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 


## Getting Started

GIVEN I am using a daily planner webpage to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner webpage
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green)
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
